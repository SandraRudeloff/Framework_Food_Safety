# Analytical Epidemiological Studies
Analytical epidemiological studies aim to explore associations between exposures and outcomes within populations. They can differ in 
1. [[#Purposes|purpose]]
2. [[#Study Designs|study design]]
3. analytical method used (logistic regression, [[Machine Learning#Random Forest (RF)|random forest]], [[Binomial Trial]], ...)  
4. [[#Surrogate Population Exposure Data|data source]] 

## Purposes
Analytical Epidemiological Studies can  be used in different situations during investigations of foodborne disease outbreaks: 
1. **refine a hypotheses:** In outbreaks where **cases do not have an obvious common place of exposure,** the analytical epidemiological study will often be designed as a case-control study where patients with the disease (cases) will be compared to a group of persons without the disease (controls) regarding the frequency of exposure to the suspected food items [[@rosner.etal2020]]
2. **test a hypotheses** in absence of microbiological evidence, A well-conducted case-control study may substantiate or form core evidence as to the vehicle of a foodborne outbreak and is often a very important investigation tool, particularly in situations where microbiological proof cannot be obtained. @kuhn.ethelberg2021
3. for prevention, e.g. for [[Source Attribution Studies]] ( @gu.etal2015 or [Gillespie et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20586610/))

## Study Designs
Instead of just analyzing the status of sick or non-sick, it is also possible to do a case-severity analysis as in @giraudon.etal2009
- [[Case Control Studies]]:  standard analytical epidemiological method in foodborne disease outbreak investigations. Due to their limitations alternate methods might also be used, such as a different study design or using a surrogate for control data. 
- [[Case-Crossover Studies]]
	- mainly used to test a hypothesis, when you already have a hypotheses for the implicated food item
- [[Case-Case Studies]]
	- these can also be used to generate hypotheses 
- [[Case-Chaos Studies]]
	- does not seem to be very convincing in general @doerken.etal2014
- [[Case-Cohort Studies]]

## Surrogate Population Exposure Data
Surrogate Population Exposure Data refers to alternative data sources that estimate the exposure levels of populations to specific risk factors (e.g., contaminated food) when traditional control groups are not feasible or available. 
- [[POS Data]]
- [[Exposure data from sporadic cases and past outbreaks]]
- [[Population-based food consumption surveys]]
- [[Market Share data]]
