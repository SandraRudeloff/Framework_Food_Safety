Interviews are conducted to gain information about the food history of cases. This is the standard way.
There is different types of interviews depending on the stage of the outbreak. In the preliminary phase of the investigation interviews may be more wide-ranging and open-ended while later on interviews are more systematic by use of a standard questionnaire. @worldhealthorganizationwho2008

# Problems with interviews
1. time intensive
2. recall bias / poor patient recall @worldhealthorganizationwho2008
	- particularly when the product is a side dish (e.g. salad leaves or raw vegetables) or an ingredient of the main dish (e.g. herbs or spices), so called ‘stealth vehicles’ 
	  @byrne.etal2016; @efsapanelonbiologicalhazardsefsabiohazpanel.etal2019
	- time delay between exposure and follow-up interviews reduces accurate patient recall 
	  @byrne.etal2016; @centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2011
	- respondent and interviewer biases in reporting of exposures may also lead to inaccurate reporting @byrne.etal2016 
	- especially when the incubation period is long, e.g. for [[Listeria]] [Becker et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00003-021-01336-y)
	- Morbidity and mortality contribute to limited patient recall, e.g. for [[Listeria]] [Becker et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00003-021-01336-y)
1. common consumption of bundled food (e.g. salsas, burritos, salads)
