There is no general procedure for foodborne disease outbreak investigations that fits every event perfectly, but there is a set of standard elements to any investigation 
Goal of investigation: identify the food item that caused the outbreak in a timely manner and to enable public health and food safety authorities to implement control measures that will stop the outbreak and prevent further illness [[[@rosner.etal2020]] 

# 1. Detect Outbreak
*Unusual accumulation of disease reports has to be identified and confirmed as pertaining to the same strain* 
- laboratory test to specify the pathogen and corresponding microbiological "fingerprinting" or genetic sequencing of strains to verify case relatedness
- Aiding in the detection of local and global outbreaks of foodborne diseases is [[@centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2023a|PulseNet]] [@cardimfalcao.etal2024]
- Case definition is usually based on clinical symptoms and/or laboratory testing 
	- The bacteria causing the illness
	- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] fingerprint of the bacteria, e.g. using [[Whole Genome Sequencing|WGS]]
	- When the illnesses occurred
	- Symptoms of the illness

- [c] While DNA fingerprinting is a vita step it is time-intensive

# 2. Identify the food vector causing the outbreak (Source attribution)
**Epidemiological** process of interviewing cases to identify common foods consumed, combining this with microbiological sampling of culprit foods and food surfaces

> [!Attention]- Time is of essence
> Time is of essence, but complexity, dynamics and massive size of food supply chains means that there are a huge number of potential sources of outbreaks and it is not feasible to test them all, or even a meaningful fraction of them, in a short period of time -> Identifying the origin of illness in multi-state outbreaks is characterized by typical timelines of 1-2 months, completed in many cases after the outbreak is almost over

## 2.1. Generate Hypotheses about Outbreak Sources by using 
- Information on Person, Place and Time (spatiotemporal and sociodemographic distribution of cases, foods consumed and other exposures)
- Prior experience with the outbreak strain 
- Routine-enteric illness interviews  
- Hypothesis generating interviews 

> [!WARNING] Problems with interviews
> 1. time intensive
> 2. recall bias / poor patient recall
> 	- particularly when the product is a side dish (e.g. salad leaves or raw vegetables) or an ingredient of the main dish (e.g. herbs or spices), so called ‘stealth vehicles’ [@byrne.etal2016; @efsapanelonbiologicalhazardsefsabiohazpanel.etal2019] 
> 	- time delay between exposure and follow-up interviews reduces accurate patient recall [@byrne.etal2016; @centersfordiseasecontrolandpreventioncdc2011]
> 	- respondent and interviewer biases in reporting of exposures may also lead to inaccurate reporting [@byrne.etal2016]
> 3. common consumption of bundled food (e.g. salsas, burritos, salads)

## 2.2. Test hypotheses by epidemiological studies
analytical investigations, such as case-control and cohort studies 
e.g. comparing what sick people ate to what people who are not part of the outbreak ate

### Case-Control Studies
When cases do not have an obvious common place of exposure, the analytical epidemiological study will often be designed as a case-control study where patients with the disease (cases) will be compared to a group of persons without the disease (controls) regarding the frequency of exposure to the suspected food items 
- Problem: Consumed food items named frequently by case-patients in exploratory interviews may be food items that are consumed with high frequency in the general population as well and may not necessarily be causative for the infection in the outbreaks 
  -> use data regarding the consumption of certain food items in the general population available for comparison with data from exploratory interviews

[[Case Control Studies|case-control studies]]

## 2.3. Confirm the contaminated food using epidemiologic and laboratory information and identify the point of contamination
laboratory

> [!WARNING] Problem with laboratory tests
> - If the infectious dose of the pathogen is low, so contaminated food capable of causing illness may contain very low levels of bacteria that are challenging to detect in food or environmental samples using traditional laboratory culture techniques, e.g. the infectious dose of STEC O157 is low [@byrne.etal2016]

# 3. Identify the location source of the outbreak at a farm or processing center
especially tracing for fresh produce items that have no bar codes, no packages and are quickly consumed often with other produce, tracing is complicated [@horn]
- complexity of distribution systems
- multiple sources of product at the point of sale
- underreporting
- significant time lags in the effects of contaminated food 
- inconsistencies and gaps in labeling and distribution records 

- triangulation or backward tracing of the distribution paths of products from several locations to determine if there is a common point of convergence in the supply chain, for example a common date and location of harvest or place of manufacture
- If identified, the contaminated foods can be traced forward from the contamination origin to determine transmission routes and identify products and consumers at risk
- final stage: evaluation of the specific practices at the farm, transportation, or other facility that may have caused outbreak


> [!NOTE]- Company tracing systems
> While many producer, manufacturer and retailers have product tracing systems in place, these systems vary depending on the amount of information recorded, how far forward or backwards in the supply chain the system tracks, technologies ued to maintain records and the precision with which a system can pinpoint a product's movement; Secondary source [@horn] citing

# 4. Control & Decide the Outbreak is Over
Measures:
- Recalling the food
- Warning people not to eat or sell the food
- Telling people how to make the food safe to eat (such as cooking to a certain temperature)
- Temporarily closing restaurants or processing plants
- Improving practices to prevent contamination during food production or harvesting
